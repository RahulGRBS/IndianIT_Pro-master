## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

1. Are Indian ITians less satified owing to low CTC than Rest of the world?
2. Which programming language is HOT in India and Rest of the World?
3. Does Indian Technocrats are optimistic or pessimistic ?


The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

- Data Files
The enclosed data set is the full, cleaned results of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Free response submissions and personally identifying information have been removed from the results to protect the privacy of respondents. There are three files besides this README:

1. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name
3. so_survey_2019.pdf - PDF file of survey instrument


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available .(Will share soon)
